As you can see there are some views that can't be created due to view dependencies.
This is not mistake of pipeline that I have developed
As you know, Views related each other in database.
If you are going to create the view by referencing non_existed view, then it doesn't pass successfully.
In here, there is a issue like it.

I checked your oracle database already, there is no in there

Non_existing Views: 
  -"FMS_REFUND_ORDER_DETAILS"
     Referencing views for this views
	5:"FMSV_BAIL_REFUND_ORDER_SUMMARY_TEMP"
	26:"FMSV_BAIL_REFUND_ORDER_SUMMARY"
	34:"FMSV_CB_REFUND_DETAILS"
	72:"FMSV_FD_HOME_DASHBOARD"
	122:"FMSV_REFUND_ORDER_SUMMARY"
  these view can't be created because FMS_REFUND_ORDER_DETAILS don't  exit
  -"FMSV_BAIL_REFUND_ORDER_SUMMARY"
    Referencing views for this views
	22:"FMSV_BAIL_JAV_TRANS_DETAILS"
	24:"FMSV_BAIL_PA_ENQUIRY"
	27:"FMSV_BAIL_REFUND_TRANS_DETAILS"
	28:"FMSV_BAIL_REUSED_TRANS_DETAILS"
  -"FMSV_REFUND_ORDER_SUMMARY"
	139:"FMSV_WF_RECEIPT_BALANCE_AMOUNT"
